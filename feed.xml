<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h1>
<p>While fewer maintainers answered than I hoped for and the survey is in no means representative, my takeaway is that many maintainers (40%) want to monetize their projects and could decide it on their own (most projects have very few maintainers). If monetization would work it should yield an income of about 6.6k USD per month or 80k USD per year to enable the maintainers to work part-time (25%) or full-time (33%) on their projects. Furthermore, almost a quarter of the maintainers (23%) would even agree to force/pressure companies to dedicate 3% of their revenue to open source projects.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jörg Rech</name></author><category term="open-source" /><category term="monetization" /><category term="survey" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jörg published the results of his survey on dev.to: State of OSS Monetization 2022]]></summary></entry></feed>
