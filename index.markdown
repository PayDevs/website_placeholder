<h2>Current State of Developing Open Source</h2>

Millions of open-source software tools, libraries, databases, etc. ...

<h2>Problems of OSS Maintainers</h2>

<p>More and more maintainers of open source software - and especially open source libraries - are falling into the trap that the more users rely on their libraries, the more features are required, bugs need to be fixed, usage has to be explained, and issues need to be resolved. While the demand is flattering in the beginning, this causes more and more work without pay.</p>

<p>This situation can discourage maintainers and lead to abandoned projects, developer burnout, or mistakes. Some well-known examples in the last years were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(March 2016): A Maintainer unpublished over 250 libraries (esp. <code>left-pad</code>) from NPM due to a trademark infringement quarrel over the name "kik".</li>
  <li>(April 2020) Maintainers of the library <code>is-promised</code> didn't adhere to the proper ES module standards causing wide-spread build errors.</li>
  <li>(Aug. 2021) The ownership of the package <code>bebop</code> was auto-transferred due to a corrupt contact address of the former owner.</li>
  <li>(Aug. 2021): Elasticsearch changed its widely used JS library to not work with AWS Elasticsearch and OpenSearch anymore.</li>
  <li>(Dec 2021): log4j included a feature from 2013 that allowed loading of arbitrary code (now called <code>log4shell</code>).</li>
  <li>(Jan. 2022): Marak changes and deletes his projects <code>Colors.js</code> and <code>Faker.js</code> after trying to monetize them without success.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Approaches of OSS Monetization</h2>

<p>Based on a recent <a href="https://dev.to/joergrech/state-of-oss-monetization-2022-survey-results-5hfl">survey on OSS Monetization</a> from March 2022 and our research into the topic, we've found over 38 <a href="https://paydevs.github.io/awesome-oss-monetization/">OSS Monetization approaches</a> - mostly without the potential to support a maintainer full-time.</p>

<p>Therefore, we're developing a novel approach that might bring enough money into the ecosystem to fund maintainers of well-used open-source libraries.</p>
